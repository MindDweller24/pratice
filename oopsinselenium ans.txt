2) In selenium we used oops concept like Polymorphism,encapsulation,inheritance and abstraction
 

3)method overloading in selenium

>in framework we use method overloading in 
*all the methods of actions class
*move to element(),context click(),double click() etc
*add arguments and assert class() are also examples

realtime---phonepe (in phonepe we can search contact using both name and number)


4)method overriding in selenium

>in framework we use methodoverriding in
*ITest listener methods are overrided in listener implementation class
*retry analyzer
*  all the methods of search context ,webdriver & webelement i/f are overided in remote webdriver


realtime----updation of any software


5)encapsulation in selenium

>in framework we use encapsulation 
* to create pom class(in pom class wby making variable as private


realtime----ATM pin generation,gmail application login


6)inheritance in selenium

>We are using hirerarchical inheritance in our framework
* Baseclass we use inheritance because every class is extends from baseclass for code reusability
* architecture of selenium is Inheritance


realtime------The class 'Car' inherits its properties from the class 'Automobiles' which inherits some of its properties from another class 'Vehicles
* child and parents, all the properties of father are inherited by his son. ...


7)Abstraction in selenium

>in framework we use Abstraction 
*webdriver driver=new Chromedriver();
we know how all methods of webdriver funtionality but we dont know implementation

realtime----Atm machine,Mobile etc


8) upcasting to webdriver insted of remotewebdriver

>webDriver i/f is implemented in Remote Webdriver class
remote webdriver class implements in other interfaces like javascriptexecutor,Takesscreenshot etc  so to avoid unnecessary methods .


9)challenges faced in selenium ??how to overcome it

>cross browser testing
>scalability testingh
>Synchronizing Events
>Handling Dynamic Elements
>Pop up and Alert Handling
>Captcha or OTP Handling
>Limited Reporting
>Timeout or Sync Issue
> Page Loading Issues
>Multi-Tab Testing
>Integration with different software
>Framework enhancement & maintenance
>Smart locators
